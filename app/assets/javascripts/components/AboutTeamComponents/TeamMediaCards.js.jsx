        <p> Jacob, one of our co-founders, is always on the hunt to fix broken things. One day while staring at a loose screw on a bus in San Francisco, he got frustrated because he knew he could fix it, but did not bring any tools to work that day. </p>
        <p> He wished he could snap a picture and post it, and then the next fixer could solve the issue. <b>And FixStart was born</b>. </p>
        <p> Jacob, Marshall, Tim, and Andrea designed a mobile responsive app for FixStart and launched it in August 2015 at the <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a> Demo Day.</p>
        <p>Our project is open source, and we would be thrilled if you could contribut to it via our <a href="https://github.com/ShadyLogic/fixstarter">GitHub</a>. Enjoy our community! <b>Fix shit, today</b>. </p>
